## Data

I have coverted the CSV to JSON to hunt the goal. This was done to have a little ease in the development process.
Then, I created a file called `data.functions.js` to create different functions to provide different stats and information.

## Page Load Time

Page load time in the Chrome's private window is 8 seconds. Intially, it was taking 13 seconds, then i reduced the size of the images and removed the unused css using `PurgeCSS`, and achieved the load time of 8 seconds. I used brower's network tool to find out the load time and then cross-checked it using analytic tools like GTmatrix and Web.Dev.
Next.js can be used to reduce the load time to even less than 2 seconds, I have used Next.js for the similar reason while building `dsckiet.com`.
